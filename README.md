This is a collection of useful commands of some of the tools I use on a regalar basis.

- [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

In the near future, I will add docs for 
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- Linux/MacOS command line.

I will soon create a new branch with my configuratiion files for the different
utilities, incase anyone is interested in getting a quick and easy start.

If you have any suggestions for useful tools please let me know by either 
opening an issue, creating a pull request or dropping me an [email](mailto:charmaine.ndolo@yahoo.de). 
Suggestions for improvements are equally welcome.
